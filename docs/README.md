## Project SLHack
Welcome to our hackathon project!  This is an experimental look at what can be done with Flutter when you think outside the bounds of a mobile screen and an app.  We believe that storytelling comes in all forms, and even a narrative told from some simple screens can be a powerful one.  We hope you enjoy this little taster of what flutter can do!
